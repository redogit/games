# MMO World Beta — Conscience64

Canonical public launch surface: `play/mmo-world/`.

This page directly runs the already gated Explorer World client while exposing the larger MMO direction, slow-growth boundary, internal service protocols, optional Bluetooth/gamepad companion layer, a bounded world-variety system, and a local data-only Arcade Forge.

## Current truth

- **Playable:** yes — the deterministic Explorer shard.
- **Live networked MMORPG:** no.
- **Accounts/shared authoritative state:** not yet.
- **Advertising surface:** yes — this is the stable URL to advertise gradually.
- **World Variety Lab:** yes — each region has curated adjective pools across light, sound, flora, fauna, motion, mood, mystery, and danger. A player can advance a deterministic local variety generation without changing map/combat/progression/reward semantics.
- **Arcade Forge:** yes — local data-only mini-game recipe builder/tester/import/export shelf. Plug-in rewards are preview metadata only and do not modify canonical Explorer state.
- **Starter Arcade pack:** ten validated recipes: the duck-rescue sample plus four Monster Mood states, three exact Cipher Snap puzzles, one bounded Make Something seed, and Redline Classic.
- **Redline timing:** admitted through one bounded `timing` mechanic. Imported data supplies only delay/reward metadata; trusted canonical runtime code performs local timing.
- **Bluetooth:** optional, user-initiated Web Bluetooth connection plus Gamepad API support for controllers already paired by the operating system.
- **Internal DNS:** deployment configuration is under `../../infra/internal-dns/`; it is not required for the static game to run.

## World varieties

`varieties.mjs` defines curated per-region adjective pools. `describeRegion(region, generation, seed)` is deterministic and replayable; the same seed and generation produce the same descriptor set. `variety-ui.mjs` stores only the local descriptive generation in browser storage. Resetting the variety returns generation zero.

The current variety mechanism is intentionally descriptive. It does not mutate combat rules, map geometry, progression, rewards, scientific claims, or the canonical Explorer shard. That boundary lets the world become more expressive without turning flavor experiments into hidden gameplay changes.

Major world/canon releases remain slow and deliberate. Local adjective mutations are player-side presentation variations, not major releases or changes to the two-year major-update cadence.

## Arcade Forge

`forge/` is the admitted successor of the useful **data-only plug-in idea** from the retired `play/mmo/` branch. It does not revive that old parallel MMO architecture.

The canonical machine contract is `plugin-contract.json`; validation/runtime code is `plugin-runtime.mjs`. Supported mechanics are `choice`, `input`, `creative`, and `timing`.

The contract deliberately rejects unknown top-level and reward fields, excessive rewards, duplicate choice/answer items after normalization, oversized files, excessive local shelf entries, malformed stored shelves, unsupported mechanics, timing ranges outside the declared bounds, plug-in clocks/timer callbacks, and reaction-time thresholds. Imported files have no executable JavaScript, interpreted HTML, URL field, network, server, account, multiplayer, commerce, or prize authority.

The Forge page uses `connect-src 'none'` and renders imported/player text with DOM text nodes/text content. Stored recipes remain browser-local. A corrupt local shelf fails visibly and is not silently replaced by an empty shelf.

**Important:** plug-in reward numbers are local preview metadata. They are not applied to canonical game state, authoritative achievements, or real-world prizes.

### Starter Arcade pack

`plugins/README.md` records the exact adaptation boundary from the retired mini-game runtime.

- **Monster Mood:** the old runtime chose one of four moods randomly. The starter pack preserves all four possible mood states as four fixed `choice` recipes. This is source-state coverage, not preservation of the old random selection mechanism.
- **Cipher Snap:** all three original finite puzzles map directly to `input` recipes.
- **Make Something:** one bounded old-style material/purpose combination maps to a `creative` recipe; the old random generator is not claimed preserved.
- **Redline Classic:** `timing-runtime.mjs` adapts the source interaction: a random wait in `[900,2700)` ms, false start before GO, and monotonic reaction measurement after GO. The old success/false-start reward values are preserved only as preview metadata.

Redline status:

`CORE_INTERACTION_SEMANTICS_ADAPTED / OLD_STATE_AUTHORITY_NOT_PRESERVED`

There is no reaction-time pass/fail threshold. Reaction time is not an accessibility gate, player-worth measure, canonical progression condition, or prize score. The preview includes **Show signal now (practice)** so waiting for a random signal is optional.

`timing-runtime.test.mjs` tests the source wait range, false start, monotonic measurement, practice signal, and cancellation with injected clocks/timers. `forge/test.mjs` enumerates and validates all ten JSON recipes. The Forge Chrome smoke exercises false-start and practice-reaction paths in the rendered page.

## Protocols

`protocols.json` records DU-SD/1, DU-CAP/1, DU-WATCH/1, and DU-BT/1. These are versioned application contracts layered on standard DNS/BLE/browser facilities, not replacements for those wire protocols.

## Growth

Advertising is an intake mechanism, not permission for uncontrolled population growth. Expand cohorts only when safety, recovery, moderation/support capacity, stability, and operating cost remain within declared bounds.

## Fuzzball

The hidden Fuzzball game is newly introduced and remains separate from the unresolved historical Fuzzball project identity preserved by Conscience64 recovery records. Unlisted/noindex distribution is not a security boundary.
