# Conscience64 MMO RPG — Twelve Levels Up + The Mystery 13th

This document zooms the game from one immediate player action to the entire world ecosystem. Each level must preserve the lower levels rather than silently replacing them.

## 1. Action
One tap, keypress, choice, move, answer, build step, conversation, scan, race input, or creative act.

**Invariant:** an action is observable and reversible where practical.

## 2. Activity
A short thing worth doing: a mini-game, puzzle, monster interaction, maker task, conversation, exploration event, or cooperative job.

**Invariant:** activities should be enjoyable or useful without requiring a reward.

## 3. Session
A bounded play period containing activities, discoveries, identity choices, world events, and a local chronicle.

**Invariant:** stopping is allowed; failure must not erase meaningful discoveries by default.

## 4. Player Life
The player's evolving roles, preferences, creations, discoveries, relationships, history, and chosen direction.

**Invariant:** role != worth. Progress systems may unlock options but must not score human value.

## 5. Place
Districts, towns, wild areas, buildings, arcades, maker spaces, laboratories, races, gardens, ruins, and strange locations.

**Invariant:** each place has a reason to exist beyond visual decoration.

## 6. World
Ripping Many Arms Off and future regions: changing ecology, monsters, stories, games, social spaces, jobs, creative systems, events, seasons, and exploration.

**Invariant:** the world may surprise the player, but it must remain legible enough to act in.

## 7. Community
Players cooperating, competing, teaching, trading permitted in-game items, forming groups, staging events, making games, and helping improve the world.

**Invariant:** participation, consent, accessibility, moderation, and safety boundaries precede growth metrics.

## 8. Game Network
Authoritative multiplayer state, matchmaking, event scheduling, identity/account boundaries, anti-cheat, persistence, moderation, version compatibility, and server observability.

**Invariant:** local client state is not authoritative for scarce or real-world rewards.

## 9. Prize & Fulfillment Layer
Optional free-entry, skill/achievement-based real-world rewards with official rules, verified achievements, eligibility checks, fraud controls, privacy minimization, fulfillment, support, and dispute handling.

**Invariant:** no purchase, wager, purchasable random chance, or cash-equivalent loot-box mechanic is required to participate in the current design. Prize claims require server-side verification and published rules.

## 10. Conscience64 Cooperation Layer
The game uses the public read-only Conscience64 browser API for bounded context, research/project retrieval, lessons, graph traversal, and IRPO records.

**Invariant:** `CONSCIENCE64_RETRIEVAL != INDEPENDENT_EVIDENCE`. Research context can seed games or questions; it cannot silently become proof, authority, or prize verification.

## 11. Platform Ecosystem
Web, desktop, mobile, console, accessibility surfaces, creator tooling, APIs, saved-world transport, version history, localization, community extensions, and deployment infrastructure.

**Invariant:** platform differences must not erase player identity, provenance, accessibility, or world history.

## 12. Human Purpose
Why the whole thing exists: fun, curiosity, doing things, being someone, creating, helping, discovering, cooperating, learning, laughing, and having a world worth returning to.

**Invariant:** the system serves human life and enjoyment; the human does not exist to optimize the system.

## Mystery 13th — Annual Emergent Result
The Mystery 13th is **not another ordinary layer**. It is the yearly result produced by the interaction of Levels 1–12.

It is evaluated after the year's actual actions, play, communities, failures, creations, changes, evidence, and surprises exist. It must not be predetermined merely to satisfy a roadmap.

Possible forms include a new world rule, annual story arc, community-created place, surprising game mechanic, research question, cultural artifact, shared lesson, or an explicit unresolved remainder.

**Invariant:** `MYSTERY_13TH != PREPLANNED_LEVEL_13`.

**Annual rule:** preserve the evidence and history of all 12 levels, then derive or select the Mystery 13th from what genuinely emerged. If no defensible result emerges, the Mystery 13th may be explicitly `UNRESOLVED` rather than fabricated.

---

## Compression

`Action → Activity → Session → Player Life → Place → World → Community → Network → Prize Layer → Conscience64 → Platform Ecosystem → Human Purpose → [annual emergence] Mystery 13th`

Going upward changes scope, not ownership of truth. A success at one level does not automatically establish success at a higher one.

Examples:

- winning a mini-game != being a better person;
- a local score != verified multiplayer achievement;
- a verified multiplayer achievement != prize eligibility;
- a Conscience64 retrieval != independent evidence;
- a fun prototype != a functioning MMO network;
- a functioning MMO network != a healthy community;
- twelve active levels != a predetermined Mystery 13th.
